Problem: Routes wouldn't work because 2 routes were the same bar a variable
at the end. Example:
// Get review by rating
router.get('/reviews/:rating', reviewController.getFilteredReviews);

// Get review by search term
router.get('/reviews/:searchTerm', reviewController.searchReviews);

Solution: Make sure routes before :variable are different.
