1. filename wouldn't work because I used a capital N, and it should be all lower case.
2. Couldn't use uuid, as subpath of v4 or v5 not defined.

Solution:
Install specific version in terminal, input this:
npm i --s uuid/v5

3. req.file.path giving backslashes.

Solution:
Use this regular expression to replace the backslashes with forward slashes:
req.file.path.replace(/\\/g, "/")
