1. Add this code to your controller to make sure
the ID of the author of the post is the same as the ID
of the author who made the request:

if(post.author.toString() !== req.userData.userId) {
        const error = new HttpError(
            'You are not allowed to edit this post',
            401
        );
        return next(error);
    }

    Make sure you convert post author to string as it's mongoose object ID
    type by default, so this will cause the comparison to not be equal even if the IDs
    are equal.

2. It's the same code but only slightly different for deleting a post:

if(post.author.id !== req.userData.userId) {
        const error = new HttpError(
            'You are not allowed to delete this post',
            401
        );
        return next(error);
    }


Bonus Note:

Error 401: Unauthorised

Error 403: Forbidden in general

Error 403 more suitable for invalid tokens or not
invalid credentials for signing up or logging in.
